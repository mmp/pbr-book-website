</p>
<p>Through the early years of computer graphics in the 1970s, the most
important problems to solve were fundamental issues like visibility algorithms
and geometric representations.  When a megabyte of RAM was a rare and
expensive luxury and when a computer capable of a million floating-point
operations per second cost hundreds of thousands of dollars, the complexity
of what was possible in computer graphics was correspondingly limited, and
any attempt to accurately simulate physics for rendering was infeasible. 

</p>
<p>As computers have become more capable and less expensive, it became
possible to consider more computationally demanding approaches to
rendering, which in turn has made physically based approaches viable.
This progression is neatly explained by <em>Blinn&rsquo;s law</em>: &ldquo;as technology
advances, rendering time remains constant.&rdquo;

</p>
<p>Jim Blinn&rsquo;s simple statement captures an important constraint: given a
certain number of images that must be rendered (be it a handful for a
research paper or over a hundred thousand for a feature film), it&rsquo;s only
possible to take so much processing time for each one. One has a certain
amount of computation available and one has some amount of time available
before rendering must be finished, so the maximum computation per image
is necessarily limited.

</p>
<p>Blinn&rsquo;s law also expresses the observation that there remains a gap between
the images people would like to be able to render and the images that they
can render: as computers have become faster, content creators have
continued to use increased computational capability to render more
complex scenes with more sophisticated rendering algorithms, rather than
rendering the same scenes as before, just more quickly. Rendering continues
to consume all of the computational capabilities made available to it.

<span id="Research"></span><h3>1.7.1  Research</h3><p>


</p>
<p>Physically based approaches to rendering started to be seriously considered
by graphics researchers in the 1980s.  Whitted&rsquo;s paper (<a href="Further_Reading.html#cite:Whitted80">1980</a>) introduced
the idea of using ray tracing for global lighting effects, opening the door
to accurately simulating the distribution of light in scenes. The rendered
images his approach produced were markedly different from any that had been
seen before, which spurred excitement about this approach.

</p>
<p>Another notable early advancement in physically based rendering was Cook and
Torrance&rsquo;s reflection model (<a href="Further_Reading.html#cite:Cook81">1981</a>, <a href="Further_Reading.html#cite:Cook82">1982</a>), which introduced microfacet
reflection models to graphics. Among other contributions, they showed that
accurately modeling microfacet reflection made it possible to render metal
surfaces accurately; metal was not well rendered by earlier approaches.

</p>
<p>Shortly afterward, Goral et al. (<a href="Further_Reading.html#cite:Goral1984">1984</a>) made connections between the thermal
transfer literature and rendering, showing how to incorporate global
diffuse lighting effects using a physically based approximation of light
transport.  This method was based on finite-element methods, where areas of
surfaces in the scene exchanged energy with each other. This approach came
to be referred to as &ldquo;radiosity,&rdquo; after a related physical unit.
Following work by Cohen and Greenberg (<a href="Further_Reading.html#cite:Cohen1985">1985</a>) and Nishita and Nakamae (<a href="Further_Reading.html#cite:Nishita1985">1985</a>)
introduced important improvements. Once again, a physically based approach
led to images with lighting effects that hadn&rsquo;t previously been seen in
rendered images, which led to many researchers pursuing improvements in
this area.

</p>
<p>While the radiosity approach was strongly based on physical units and
conservation of energy, in time it became clear that it didn&rsquo;t lead to
viable rendering algorithms: the asymptotic computational complexity was a

</svg>, and it was necessary to be able to
re-tessellate geometric models along shadow boundaries for good results;
researchers had difficulty developing robust and efficient tessellation
algorithms for this purpose and radiosity&rsquo;s adoption in practice was
limited.

</p>
<p>During the radiosity years, a small group of researchers pursued
physically based approaches to rendering that were based on ray tracing and
Monte Carlo integration.  At the time, many looked at their work with
skepticism; objectionable noise in images due to variance from Monte
Carlo integration seemed unavoidable, while radiosity-based methods quickly
gave visually pleasing results, at least on relatively simple scenes.

</p>
<p>In 1984, Cook, Porter, and Carpenter introduced distributed ray tracing,
which generalized Whitted&rsquo;s algorithm to compute motion blur and defocus blur
from cameras, blurry reflection from glossy surfaces, and illumination from
area light sources (Cook et&nbsp;al.&nbsp;<a href="Further_Reading.html#cite:Cook84">1984</a>), showing that ray tracing was capable
of generating a host of important lighting effects.

</p>
<p>Shortly afterward, Kajiya (<a href="Further_Reading.html#cite:Kajiya86">1986</a>) introduced path tracing; he set out
a rigorous formulation of the rendering problem (the light transport
integral equation) and showed how to apply Monte Carlo integration to
solve it.  This work required immense amounts of computation: to render a

</svg> pixel image of two spheres with path tracing required 7
hours of computation on an IBM 4341 computer, which cost roughly $280,000
when it was first released (Farmer&nbsp;<a href="Further_Reading.html#cite:Farmer1981">1981</a>).  With von Herzen, Kajiya also
introduced the volume-rendering equation to graphics (Kajiya and von Herzen
<a href="Further_Reading.html#cite:Kajiya84">1984</a>); this equation rigorously describes the scattering of light in
participating media.

</p>
<p>Both Cook et&nbsp;al.&rsquo;s and Kajiya&rsquo;s work once again led to images unlike any
that had been seen before, demonstrating the value of physically based
methods.  In subsequent years, important work on Monte Carlo for realistic
image synthesis was described in papers by Arvo and Kirk (<a href="Further_Reading.html#cite:Arvo90pt">1990</a>) and Kirk and Arvo (<a href="Further_Reading.html#cite:Kirk91">1991</a>).  Shirley&rsquo;s Ph.D. dissertation (<a href="Further_Reading.html#cite:Shirley90phd">1990</a>)
and follow-on work by Shirley et al. (<a href="Further_Reading.html#cite:Shirley96">1996</a>) were important contributions to Monte Carlo&ndash;based efforts.
Hall&rsquo;s book, <em>Illumination and Color in Computer Generated Imagery</em>,
(<a href="Further_Reading.html#cite:Hall89">1989</a>) is one of the first books to present rendering in a
physically based framework, and Andrew Glassner&rsquo;s <em>Principles of
Digital Image Synthesis</em> rigorously laid out foundations of the field
(<a href="Further_Reading.html#cite:Glassner:PODIS">1995</a>).  Ward&rsquo;s <em>Radiance</em>
rendering system was an early open source
physically based rendering system, focused on lighting design (Ward&nbsp;<a href="Further_Reading.html#cite:Ward94">1994</a>),
and Slusallek&rsquo;s <em>Vision</em> renderer was designed to bridge the gap
between physically based approaches and the then widely used RenderMan
interface, which wasn&rsquo;t physically based (Slusallek&nbsp;<a href="Further_Reading.html#cite:SlusallekThesis">1996</a>).

</p>
<p>Following Torrance and Cook&rsquo;s work, much of the research in the Program of
Computer Graphics at Cornell University investigated physically based
approaches. The motivations for this work were summarized by Greenberg et al. (<a href="Further_Reading.html#cite:Greenberg:1997:AFF">1997</a>), who made a strong argument for a physically accurate rendering
based on measurements of the material properties of real-world objects and
on deep understanding of the human visual system.

</p>
<p>A crucial step forward for physically based rendering was Veach&rsquo;s work,
described in detail in his dissertation (Veach&nbsp;<a href="Further_Reading.html#cite:VeachThesis">1997</a>).  Veach advanced key
theoretical foundations of Monte Carlo rendering while also developing new
algorithms like multiple importance sampling, bidirectional path tracing,
and Metropolis light transport that greatly improved its efficiency. Using
Blinn&rsquo;s law as a guide, we believe that 
these significant improvements in efficiency were critical
to practical adoption of these approaches.

</p>
<p>Around this time, as computers became faster and more parallel, a number of
researchers started pursuing real-time ray tracing; Wald, Slusallek, and
Benthin wrote an influential paper that described a highly optimized ray
tracer that was much more efficient than previous ray tracers (Wald et&nbsp;al.&nbsp;<a href="Further_Reading.html#cite:Wald01b">2001b</a>).  Many subsequent papers introduced increasingly more
efficient ray-tracing algorithms. Though most of this work wasn&rsquo;t
physically based, the results led to great progress in ray-tracing
acceleration structures and performance of the geometric components of ray
tracing.  Because physically based rendering generally makes substantial
use of ray tracing, this work has in turn had the same helpful effect as
faster computers have, making it possible to render more complex scenes
with physical approaches.

</p>
<p>At this point, we&rsquo;ll end our summary of the key steps in the research
progress of physically based rendering; much more has been done.  The
&ldquo;Further Reading&rdquo; sections in all of the subsequent chapters of this book
cover this work in detail.

</p>
<p>With more capable computers in the 1980s, computer graphics could start to
be used for animation and film production.  Early examples include Jim
Blinn&rsquo;s rendering of the Voyager 2 Flyby of Saturn in 1981 and visual
effects in the movies <em>Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan</em> (1982),
<em>Tron</em> (1982), and <em>The Last Starfighter</em> (1984).

</p>
<p>In early production use of computer-generated imagery, rasterization-based
rendering (notably, the Reyes algorithm (Cook et al.&nbsp;<a href="Further_Reading.html#cite:Cook87">1987</a>)) was the only
viable option.  One reason was that not enough computation was available
for complex reflection models or for the global lighting effects that
physically based ray tracing could provide.  More significantly,
rasterization had the important advantage that it didn&rsquo;t require that the
entire scene representation fit into main memory.

</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>When RAM was much less plentiful, almost any interesting scene was too
large to fit into main memory.  Rasterization-based algorithms made it
possible to render scenes while having
only a small subset of the full scene representation in memory at any
time. Global lighting effects are difficult to achieve if the whole
scene can&rsquo;t fit into main memory; for many years, with limited
computer systems, content creators effectively decided that geometric and
texture complexity was more important to visual realism than lighting
complexity (and in turn physical accuracy).

</p>
<p>Many practitioners at this time also believed that physically
based approaches were undesirable for production: one of the great things
about computer graphics is that one can cheat reality with impunity to achieve a desired artistic
effect.  For example, lighting designers on regular movies often struggle
to place light sources so that they aren&rsquo;t visible to the camera or spend
a lot of effort placing a light to illuminate an actor without shining too
much light on the background.  Computer graphics offers the opportunity to,
for example, implement a light source model that shines twice as much light
on a character as on a background object, in a fairly straightforward
manner. For many years, this capability seemed much more useful than
physical accuracy.

</p>
<p>Visual effects practitioners who had the specific need to match rendered
imagery to filmed real-world environments pioneered capturing real-world
lighting and shading effects and were early adopters of physically based
approaches in the late 1990s and early 2000s.  (See Snow (<a href="Further_Reading.html#cite:Snow2010">2010</a>) for a
history of ILM&rsquo;s early work in this area, for example.)

</p>
<p>During this time, Blue Sky Studios adopted a physically based pipeline
early in their history (Ohmer&nbsp;<a href="Further_Reading.html#cite:Ohmer1997">1997</a>). The photorealism of an advertisement
they made for a Braun shaver in 1992 caught the attention of many, and
their short film, <em>Bunny</em>, shown in 1998, was an early example of
Monte Carlo global illumination used in production.  Its visual look was
substantially different from those of films and shorts rendered with Reyes
and was widely noted.  Subsequent feature films from Blue Sky also followed
this approach.  Unfortunately, Blue Sky never published significant
technical details of their approach, limiting their wider influence.

</p>
<p>During the early 2000s, the <em>mental ray</em> ray-tracing system was used
by a number of studios, mostly for visual effects.  It was a very efficient
ray tracer with sophisticated global illumination algorithm
implementations.  The main focus of its developers was computer-aided
design and product design applications, so it lacked features like the
ability to handle extremely complex scenes and the enormous numbers of texture
maps that film production demanded.

</p>
<p>After <em>Bunny</em>, another watershed moment came in 2001, when Marcos
Fajardo came to the SIGGRAPH with an early version of his <em>Arnold</em>
renderer.  He showed images in the Monte Carlo image synthesis course that
not only had complex geometry, textures, and global illumination but also were
rendered in tens of minutes. While these scenes weren&rsquo;t of the complexity
of those used in film production at the time, his results showed many the
creative opportunities from global illumination in complex scenes. 

</p>
<p>Fajardo brought <em>Arnold</em> to Sony Pictures Imageworks, where work
started to transform it to a production-capable physically based rendering
system.  Work on efficient motion blur, programmable shading, support for
massively complex scenes and deferred loading of scene geometry, and
support for texture caching, where only a small subset of the texture in
the scene is kept in memory, were all important areas to be addressed.
<em>Arnold</em> was first used on the movie <em>Monster House</em> and is now
generally available as a product.

</p>
<p>In the mid-2000s, Pixar&rsquo;s <em>RenderMan</em> renderer started to support hybrid
rasterization and ray-tracing algorithms and included a number of
innovative algorithms for computing global illumination solutions in
complex scenes.  <em>RenderMan</em> was recently rewritten to be a physically based
ray tracer, following the general system architecture of <tt>pbrt</tt> (Christensen&nbsp;<a href="Further_Reading.html#cite:Christensen2015">2015</a>).

</p>
<p>One of the main reasons that physically based Monte Carlo approaches to
rendering have been successful in production is that they end up improving
the productivity of artists. Some of the important factors have been:
</p>
<ul>
<li> The algorithms involved have essentially just a single quality knob:
how many samples to take per pixel; this is extremely helpful for artists.
Ray-tracing algorithms are also suited to both progressive refinement and
quickly computing rough previews by taking just a few samples per pixel;
rasterization-based renderers don&rsquo;t have equivalent capabilities.

<li> Adopting physically based reflection models has made it easier to
design surface materials. Earlier, when reflection models that didn&rsquo;t
necessarily conserve energy were used, an object might be placed in a single
lighting environment while its surface reflection parameters were adjusted.
The object might look great in that environment, but it would often appear completely
wrong when moved to another lighting environment because surfaces were
actually reflecting too little or too much energy: surface properties had
been set to unreasonable values.

<li> The quality of shadows computed with ray tracing is much better than
it is with rasterization.  Eliminating the need to tweak shadow map
resolutions, biases, and other parameters has eliminated an unpleasant task
of lighting artists.  Further, physically based methods bring with them
bounce lighting and other soft-lighting effects from the method itself,
rather than as an artistically tuned manual process.

<p>As of this writing, physically based rendering is used widely for producing
computer-generated imagery for movies; Figures&nbsp;<a href="#fig:gravity">1.22</a>
and&nbsp;<a href="#fig:hobbit">1.23</a> show images from two recent movies that used
physically based approaches.
