</p>
<p>Collecting data about the runtime behavior of the system can provide a
substantial amount of insight into its behavior and opportunities for
improving its performance.  For example, we might want to track the average
number of primitive intersection tests performed for all the rays; if
this number is surprisingly high, then there may be a latent bug somewhere
in the system. <tt>pbrt</tt>&rsquo;s statistics system makes it possible to measure and
aggregate this sort of data in a variety of ways.  The statistics system is
only available with the CPU renderer; an exercise at the end of this
appendix discusses how it might be brought to the GPU.

</p>
<p>It is important to make it as easy as possible to add new measurements to
track the system&rsquo;s runtime behavior; the easier it is to do this, the more
measurements end up being added to the system, and the more likely that
&ldquo;interesting&rdquo; data will be discovered, leading to new insights and
improvements. Therefore, it is fairly easy to add new measurements to <tt>pbrt</tt>.
For example, the following lines declare two counters
that can be used to record how many times the corresponding events happen.

</p>
<p></p>
<div class="fragmentcode">STAT_COUNTER("Integrator/Regular ray intersection tests", nIsectTests);
STAT_COUNTER("Integrator/Shadow ray intersection tests", nShadowTests);</div><p>


</p>
<p>As appropriate, counters can be incremented with simple statements like
</p>
<div class="fragmentcode">  ++nIsectTests;</div><p>

With no further intervention from the
developer, the preceding is enough for the statistics system to be able to
automatically print out nicely formatted results like the following when
rendering completes:

</p>
<p></p>
<div class="fragmentcode">  Integrator
    Regular ray intersection tests                752982
    Shadow ray intersection tests                4237165</div><p>


</p>
<p>The statistics system supports the following aggregate measurements:

</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li> <tt>STAT_COUNTER("name", var)</tt>:
A count of the number of instances of an event.  The counter
variable <tt>var</tt> can be updated as if it was a regular integer
variable; for example, <tt>++var</tt> and <tt>var += 10</tt> are both valid.

<li> <tt>STAT_MEMORY_COUNTER("name", var)</tt>:
A specialized counter for recording memory usage.  In particular, the
values reported at the end of rendering are in terms of kilobytes,
megabytes, or gigabytes, as appropriate.  The counter is updated the same
way as a regular counter: <tt>var += count * sizeof(MyStruct)</tt> and so forth.

<li> <tt>STAT_INT_DISTRIBUTION("name", dist)</tt>:
Tracks the distribution of some value; at the end of rendering, the
minimum, maximum, and average of the supplied values are reported.
Call <tt>dist &lt;&lt; value</tt> to include <tt>value</tt> in the distribution.

<li> <tt>STAT_PERCENT("name", num, denom)</tt>:
Tracks how often a given event happens; the aggregate value is reported as
the percentage <tt>num/denom</tt> when statistics are printed.  Both
<tt>num</tt> and <tt>denom</tt> can be incremented as if they were
integers&mdash;for example, one might write <tt>if (event) ++num;</tt> or <tt>++denom</tt>.

<li> <tt>STAT_RATIO("name", num, denom)</tt>:
This tracks how often an event happens but reports the result as a ratio
<tt>num/denom</tt> rather than a percentage.  This is often a more useful
presentation if <tt>num</tt> is often greater than <tt>denom</tt>.  (For
example, we might record the percentage of ray&ndash;triangle intersection tests
that resulted in an intersection but the ratio of triangle intersection
tests to the total number of rays traced.)

value is based on the number of rays traced to compute the pixel&rsquo;s shaded
value.  Not only it is evident that longer paths are traced at pixels with specular
surfaces like the glasses on the tables, but it is also possible to see the
effect of Russian roulette terminating paths more quickly at darker
surfaces.  This image was generated using
<tt>STAT_PIXEL_COUNTER</tt> and only required adding two lines of code to
an integrator.

</p>
<p>In addition to statistics that are aggregated over the entire rendering,
<tt>pbrt</tt> can also measure statistics at each pixel and generate images with
their values.  Two variants are supported: <tt>STAT_PIXEL_COUNTER</tt> and
<tt>STAT_PIXEL_RATIO</tt>, which are used in the same way as the
corresponding aggregate statistics.  Per-pixel statistics are only measured
if the <tt>&ndash;pixelstats</tt> command line option is provided to <tt>pbrt</tt>.
Figure&nbsp;<a href="#fig:stat-pixel-counter">B.8</a> shows an image generated using
<tt>STAT_PIXEL_COUNTER</tt>.

</p>
<p>All the macros to define statistics trackers can only be used at file
scope and should only be used in <tt>*.cpp</tt> files (for reasons that will
become apparent as we dig into their implementations).  They specifically
should not be used in header files or function or class definitions.

</p>
<p>Note also that the string names provided for each measurement should be of
the form &ldquo;category/statistic.&rdquo;  When values are reported, everything
under the same category is reported together (as in the preceding example).

</p>
<p>There are a number of challenges in making the statistics system both
efficient and easy to use.  The efficiency challenges stem from <tt>pbrt</tt> being multi-threaded: if there was not any parallelism, we could associate
regular integer or floating-point variables with each measurement and just
update them like regular variables.  In the presence of multiple concurrent
threads of execution, however, we need to ensure that two threads do not
try to modify these variables at the same time (recall the discussion of
mutual exclusion in Section&nbsp;<a href="../Utilities/Parallelism.html#sec:atomic-ops">B.6.1</a>).

</p>
<p>While atomic operations like those described in
Section&nbsp;<a href="../Utilities/Parallelism.html#sec:atomic-ops">B.6.1</a> could be used to safely increment counters
without using a mutex, there would still be a performance impact from
multiple threads modifying the same location in memory.  Recall from
Section&nbsp;<a href="../Utilities/Parallelism.html#sec:multi-thread-memory-perf">B.6.3</a> that the cache coherence
protocols can introduce substantial overhead in this case.  Because the
statistics measurements are updated so frequently during the course of
rendering, we found that an atomics-based implementation caused the
renderer to be 10&ndash;15% slower than the following implementation, which avoids
the overhead of multiple threads frequently modifying the same memory
location.

</p>
<p>The implementation here is based on having separate counters for each
running thread, allowing the counters to be updated without atomics and
without cache coherence overhead (since each thread increments its own
counters).  This approach means that in order to report statistics, it is
necessary to merge all of these per-thread counters into final aggregate
values, which we will see is possible with a bit of trickiness.

</p>
<p>To see how this all works, we will dig into the implementation for regular
counters; the other types of measurements are all along similar lines.
First, here is the <tt>STAT_COUNTER</tt> macro, which packs three different
things into its definition.

</p>
<p></p>
<span class="anchor" id="fragment-StatisticsMacros-0"></span><div class="fragmentname">&lt;&lt;Statistics Macros&gt;&gt;=&nbsp;</div>
<div class="fragmentcode">#define <span class="anchor" id="STAT_COUNTER"></span>STAT_COUNTER(title, var)                                       \
    static thread_local int64_t var;                                   \
    static StatRegisterer STATS_REG##var([](StatsAccumulator &amp;accum) { \
        accum.ReportCounter(title, var);                               \
        var = 0;                                                       \
    });</div><p>


</p>
<p>First, and most obviously, the macro defines a 64-bit integer variable
named <tt>var</tt>, the second argument passed to the macro.  The variable
definition has the <tt>thread_local</tt> qualifier, which indicates that
there should be a separate copy of the variable for each executing thread.
This variable can then be incremented directly as appropriate to report
results.  However, given these per-thread instances, we need to be able to
sum together the per-thread values and to aggregate all the individual
counters into the final program output.

</p>
<p>To this end, the macro next defines a static variable of type
<tt>StatRegisterer</tt>, giving it a (we hope!) unique name derived from
<tt>var</tt>.  A lambda function is passed to the <tt>StatRegisterer</tt>
constructor, which stores a copy of it.  When called, the lambda passes the
current thread&rsquo;s counter value to a <tt>ReportCounter()</tt> method and then
resets the counter.  Evidently, all that is required is for this lambda to
be called by each thread and for <tt>ReportCounter()</tt> to sum up the
values provided and then report them.  (We will gloss over the
implementation of the <tt>StatsAccumulator</tt> class and methods like
<tt>ReportCounter()</tt>, as there is nothing very interesting about them.)

</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>Recall that in C++, constructors of global <tt>static</tt> objects run when
program execution starts; thus, each <tt>static</tt> instance of the
<tt>StatRegisterer</tt> class runs its constructor before <tt>main()</tt>
starts running.  This constructor, which is not included here, adds the
lambda passed to it to a <tt>std::vector</tt> that holds all such lambdas for
all the statistics.

</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>At the end of rendering, the <a href="../Utilities/Parallelism.html#ForEachThread"><tt>ForEachThread()</tt></a> function is used to
cause each thread to loop over the registered lambdas and call each of
them.  In turn, the <tt>StatsAccumulator</tt> will have all the aggregate
values when they are done.  The
<tt>PrintStats()</tt><span class="anchor" id="PrintStats"></span> function can then be called to
print all the statistics that have been accumulated in
<tt>StatsAccumulator</tt>.
